The game should not\ncontain any sounds or pictures that are likely to\nfrighten young children. A very mild form of violence\n(in a comical context or a childlike setting) is\nacceptable. No bad language should be heard."
var hint_pegi_7 := "PEGI 7\n\nGame content with scenes or sounds that can possibly be\nfrightening to younger children should fall in this\ncategory. Very mild forms of violence (implied, non-\ndetailed, or non-realistic violence) are acceptable for\na game with a PEGI 7 rating."

Sexual innuendo or sexual\nposturing can be present, while any bad language in\nthis category must be mild."

The use of bad\nlanguage in games with a PEGI 16 rating can be more\nextreme, while the use of tobacco, alcohol or illegal\ndrugs can also be present."

The\nglamorisation of the use of illegal drugs and of the\nsimulation of gambling, and explicit sexual activity\nshould also fall into this age category. "
